# Recipe
> In this application I explore setting up a rails application with react inclusive and trying to use react libraries such as redux and react-router with a rails api application.

## Built with
- Ruby on Rails
- React
- Redux
- Webback
- PostgreSQL


## Getting Started

To run and view this application, you will first have to clone a local version of this repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/RayhanTabase/hello-rails-react.git`

After that navigate to the newly created folder:

`cd hello-rails-react`

You now have access to the files.
To install necessary dependencies and packagies for node and rails run:

 `yarn install`
 `bundle install`

Configure PostgreSQL database in your project in the project directory:

`config/database.yml`

Start a local server running the command:

`./bin/dev`

On your local host, view the react component Greeting which generates a random message:

`http://127.0.0.1:3000/greetings`
